This repository is the canonical location for Noisebridge's policies & procedures and other material which we change by consensus.

If you want to propose a change: 

1. Fork this repository and make a branch with an appropriate name.
2. Make your changes and commit them with descriptive commit messages.
3. Issue a pull request for your branch and describe your change in your pull request.
4. Include a link to your pull request with your proposal on the [`Current Consensus Items` page](https://noisebridge.net/wiki/Current_Consensus_Items) on the Noisebridge wiki.

Noisebridge will then discuss your proposal at community meetings. If the proposal reaches consensus, the meeting's note-taker should inform the secretary of the change, and comment in the pull request. The secretary will then merge changes into the `master` branch.

Noisebridge's [secretary](mailto:secretary@noisebridge.net) is responsible for this repository.
